# OSCP Methodology & Command Reference

Comprehensive OSCP penetration testing notes optimized for quick command reference during exams.

## Getting started
Clone this repository locally and open it in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for the best experience.

See the "Templates" folder. Make a copy of "IP-Hostname.md" for each machine, and one copy of "AD-Domain.md" for Active Directory labs.

For each machine, start in [[Service Discovery]], and enumerate services, referring to the notes in the Commands/Services folder. After gaining initial access, escalate privileges while following the appropriate checklist in the Checklists/ folder.

If the machine is part of a larger network or domain, refer to [[CHECKLIST-Post-Exploitation]] and [[AD Domain]] to move laterally.

Notes in the Commands folder are formatted to be compatible with [vClip](https://github.com/CameronCandau/vClip), my snippet management utility.
